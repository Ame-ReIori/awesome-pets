> "For 3.5 billion years, life on earth consisted of a primordial soup of single-cell creatures. Then, within a geological eyeblink, during what is known as the Cambrian Explosion, nearly all animal phyla we recognize today emerged.
> By analogy, **we are currently experiencing a Cambrian Explosion in the field of cryptographic proofs of computational integrity (CI), a subset of which include zero knowledge proofs**. While a couple of years ago there were about 1–3 new systems a year, the rate has picked up so much that today we are seeing this same amount monthly, if not weekly."

ZKP从1986年发展至今，已经成为多个领域（区块链，匿名证书，认证系统）的基础构件。下文，我们主要对实际可用的ZKP进行阐述，并将其划分为特定目的的ZKP方案和通用目的的ZKP方案——它们的不同主要来自证明算式（陈述）的能力。
> 如果我们将此，与Partial HE和FHE对比，Specific ZK仅能证明特定的、有限的算式，通用ZK（理论上）能够证明任意算式。

## Specific ZKP


### Specific ZKP for relations over logarithm


### Membership(Range) Proof

<!-- #### Cryptographic Accumulator 这似乎就太细了 -->

## General purpose ZKP


## Applications on ZKP systems

这里简单列举几类ZKP的重点应用。
Web3, AC
Blockchain
