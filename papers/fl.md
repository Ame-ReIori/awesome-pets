# Awesome Federated Learning Paper

Federated Learning is a decentralized machine learning method that utilizes distributed computing and privacy-preserving techniques to merge the locally trained results of multiple devices or machine learning models into a global model without sharing the original data. This approach can protect personal privacy while also improving the accuracy and robustness of the model without centralizing data. Federated learning has been applied in various fields such as smartphones, healthcare, transportation, finance, and more.
