# awesome-pets

A curated list of papers and SecretFlow's tutorials on Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs). There are many ways of categorising different PETs technologies, and we decide to categorise papers into two categories:
1. Basic Tools: aims for generic scnarios
2. Applications: aims for specific scenarios

Please feel free to open a pull request.
